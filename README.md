**Name:** THATO DITLHAKE
**Student Number:** 36389676  
**Campus:** NWU Mafikeng  
**Part:** Network Topologies Design & Simulation  
**Deadline:** 13 October 2025

## 1. Overview
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of five basic topologies ‚Äî Bus, Mesh, Star, Ring, and Extended Star ‚Äî using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It also includes one Hybrid Topology that integrates features of the above and is configured with IPv4, IPv6, VLANs, and a DHCP/HTTP server.

# üåê Network Design Project - Part 1: Hybrid Topology & Inter-VLAN Services

## Overview

This project documents the design, configuration, and verification of a **Hybrid Network Topology**. The primary goal was to create a robust, segmented network utilizing Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick) to connect three distinct VLANs while providing core infrastructure services (DHCP, DNS, HTTP) over both **IPv4 and IPv6** protocols.

## üìê Project Topology Structure

The final topology is a **Hybrid Architecture** combining foundational structures and featuring a fully meshed core for redundancy.

### 1. Foundational Topologies (Proof of Concept)

The project includes preliminary designs for the following foundational topologies:

| Topology | Packet Tracer File | Verification Screenshot |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Bus** | [Bus.pkt](Topologies/Bus.pkt) | [Bus Ping Test Image](PingTest/bus_ping_test.jpg) |
| **Star** | [Star.pkt](Topologies/Star.pkt) | [Star Ping Test Image](PingTest/star_ping_test.jpg)<br>[Star Ping Test Image](PingTest/star_ping_test1.jpg) |
| **Ring** | [Ring.pkt](Topologies/Ring.pkt) | [Ring Ping Test Image](PingTest/ring_ping_test.jpg) |
| **Mesh** | [Mesh.pkt](Topologies/Mesh.pkt) | [Mesh Ping Test Image](PingTest/mesh_ping_test.jpg)<br>[Mesh Ping Test Image](PingTest/mesh_ping_test1.jpg) |
| **Extended Star**| [ExtendedStar.pkt](Topologies/ExtendedStar.pkt) | [Extended Ping Test Image](PingTest/extended_star_ping_test.jpg) |

### IPv4 Verification for Foundational Topologies

The following screenshots verify successful IPv4 configuration (either static or DHCP) for all five foundational network structures developed in Phase 1

### 2. Final Hybrid Network Segmentation (VLANs)

The hybrid network is logically segmented into three VLANs with R1 acting as the gateway for all subnets.

| VLAN ID | Name | IPv4 Subnet | IPv6 Prefix | Gateway Address (R1) |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **10** | STAFF | 192.168.10.0/24 | 2001:DB8:ACAD:10::/64 | 192.168.10.1 |
| **20** | STUDENTS | 192.168.20.0/24 | 2001:DB8:ACAD:20::/64 | 192.168.20.1 |
| **99** | SERVERS | 192.168.99.0/24 | 2001:DB8:ACAD:99::/64 | 192.168.99.1 |

### 2. DNS and Routing Verification

**Test:** `ping projectserver.com`

* **Purpose:** Confirms successful DHCP relay, DNS resolution, and Inter-VLAN routing across R1.
* **Result:** **0% Loss** observed.

### 3. Application Layer Verification (HTTP Service)

**Test:** Access `http://projectserver.com` via Web Browser.

* **Purpose:** Confirms Layer 7 service reachability.
* **Result:** The custom welcome page loaded successfully.
