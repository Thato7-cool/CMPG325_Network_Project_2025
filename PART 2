## II. Individual Network Feature Configuration 

**Feature Implemented:** Static Routes to enable communication between different network topologies (Bus, Ring, and Mesh).

### 1. Correct Configuration & Functionality (15 Marks)

Static routes were configured on R1-BUS and R2-RING to allow non-directly connected networks to communicate via the point-to-point link (10.0.0.0/30).

| Router | Destination Network | Subnet Mask | Next-Hop IP | Command Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R1-BUS** | 192.168.20.0 (Ring) | 255.255.255.0 | **10.0.0.2** | `ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2` |
| **R1-BUS** | 192.168.30.0 (Mesh) | 255.255.255.0 | **10.0.0.2** | `ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2` |
| **R2-RING** | 192.168.10.0 (Bus) | 255.255.255.0 | **10.0.0.1** | `ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1` |

#### A. Static Route Verification (Routing Table Output)

The following output from the `show ip route` command verifies that the static routes (marked with **S**) are successfully installed on the routers' routing tables.

**R1-BUS Routing Table Excerpt:**
```bash
R1-BUS#show ip route
[...omitted directly connected routes...]
S   192.168.20.0/24 [1/0] via 10.0.0.2  <- Static route to Ring LAN
S   192.168.30.0/24 [1/0] via 10.0.0.2  <- Static route to Mesh LAN
**R1-BUS Routing Table Evidence:**

R2-RING#show ip route
[...omitted directly connected routes...]
S   192.168.10.0/24 [1/0] via 10.0.0.1  <- Static route to Bus LAN
**R2-RING Routing Table Evidence:**

This successful test confirms that communication is enabled between two non-adjacent networks (Bus LAN and Extended Star LAN).

Test: Ping from PC-1A (Bus LAN - 192.168.10.2) to PC-3A (Extended-Star LAN - 192.168.30.2).

Result: SUCCESSFUL (0% loss)

**Successful Ping Test Evidence:**
